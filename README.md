# Handwritten-digit-recognition

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains centered, grayscale digits with thick white strokes on a black background.

As a result, it performs best on images that match this style.

Thin, light, or off-centered handwritten digits (such as outline-style digits or digits on white backgrounds) may lead to inaccurate predictions.
